Visual analysis of artefacts is a basic procedure in archaeological research. However, teaching the visual analysis of artefacts can be a challenge, mostly because seeing is not an entirely conscious process. To aid archaeological instructors and students in learning and teaching artefact analysis, we developed eye-tracking recordings that depict the gaze behavior of archaeological experts during artefact analysis (a method known as Eye Movement Modelling Examples - EMME). Subsequently, we presented these recordings to students during archaeological courses. The results showed that students gained various educational benefits from EMME.
