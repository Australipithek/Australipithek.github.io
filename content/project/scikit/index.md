Visual analysis of artefacts is a basic procedure in archaeological research. However, teaching the visual analysis of artefacts can be a challenge, mostly because seeing is not an entirely conscious process. To aid archaeological instructors and students in learning and teaching artefact analysis, we developed eye-tracking recordings that depict the gaze behavior of archaeological experts during artefact analysis (a method known as Eye Movement Modeling Examples, EMME). Subsequently, we presented these recordings to students during archaeological courses. The results showed that students gained various educational benefits from EMME.
